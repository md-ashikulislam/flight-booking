# flight-booking
As an ECE student,This project has been done by me under the data structure laboratory course(CSE 3210)
This is an oracle project on online flight booking management system. I have worked with some possible tables on flight booking management from booking office to the airport. I have used oracle database 11g express
edition to design and developement of the project. The E-R diagram, Schema Diagram and .sql file of the project has been added here. You just need to start the .sql file oracle, and it will create all the tables i 
have been worked with.
Now manage your database by oracle the way you want!!
